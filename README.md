# MCP Options Strategy Server

This repository contains the MCP server code for executing **Call and Put Options** on **Claude Desktop**. It provides a streamlined approach to managing options trading operations efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed
- `uv` for managing dependencies

### Setting Up Your Environment

To begin, set up your virtual environment and install uv. Then proceed as follows:

```bash
uv init mcp-server-demo
cd mcp-server-demo
```
Then add MCP to your project dependencies:
```bash
uv add "mcp[cli]"
```
To run the mcp command with uv:
```bash
uv run mcp
```
## MCP server code

```python
# server.py
# This script initializes an MCP server for options calculations, 
# providing tools to compute breakeven points and payoffs for Call and Put options.

from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from options_library import Put, Call

# Create an instance of the FastMCP server
# "Demo_Options" serves as the namespace for the tools
mcp = FastMCP("Demo_Options")

# Define a tool for Call Option analysis
@mcp.tool()
def call_option(strike: float, premium: float) -> dict:
    """
    Computes breakeven price and potential payoffs for a Call Option.
    
    Parameters:
        strike (float): Strike price of the Call option.
        premium (float): Premium paid to purchase the option.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing:
            - breakeven: Price at which the option breaks even.
            - max_profit: Theoretically infinite (since profits scale with the underlying asset price).
            - max_loss: Fixed loss, equal to the premium paid.
    """
    call = Call(strike, premium)
    return {
        "breakeven": call.breakeven(),
        "max_profit": "infinite",  # Unlimited profit potential
        "max_loss": call.premium   # Limited loss equal to the premium
    }

# Define a tool for Put Option analysis
@mcp.tool()
def put_option(strike: float, premium: float) -> dict:
    """
    Computes breakeven price and potential payoffs for a Put Option.
    
    Parameters:
        strike (float): Strike price of the Put option.
        premium (float): Premium paid to purchase the option.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing:
            - breakeven: Price at which the option breaks even.
            - max_profit: Maximum profit if asset price drops to zero.
            - max_loss: Fixed loss, equal to the premium paid.
    """
    put = Put(strike, premium)
    return {
        "breakeven": put.breakeven(),
        "max_profit": strike - premium,  # Profit is capped at the strike price minus the premium
        "max_loss": premium               # Limited loss equal to the premium
    }

```
Run the MCP server
```bash
mcp install server.py
```
